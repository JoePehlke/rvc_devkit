# Robust Vision Challenge 2020 - Panoptic and Instance Segmentation Devkit #

## Dataset Download ##

We provide a devkit to download, extract, and convert the challenge datasets into a unified format. First specifying the target root directory for all RVC datasets using an environment variable

export RVC_DATA_DIR=/path/to/rvc_dataroot

Some segmentation benchmarks require users to register and to confirm the license terms before granting access to their data.
For the Cityscapes dataset, please register at: https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com 

For the WildDash dataset, please register at: https://www.wilddash.cc (Note: RVC users can already use a alpha version of WildDash v2; see the downloaded readme/license for details).

To use the automatic download script, define these environment variables using 

```
# Copy Cityscapes credentials here
export CITYSCAPES_USERNAME="your_cs_username"
export CITYSCAPES_PASSWORD="your_cs_passwd"
# Copy WildDash credentials here
export WILDDASH_USERNAME="your_wd_username"
export WILDDASH_PASSWORD="your_wd_passwd"
```

Now you can execute the download script ``` download_inst_segm.sh ``` or ``` download_panoptic_segm.sh ``` which will download most of the RVC datasets.

You need to manually register and download the Mapillary Vistas (Research Edition) dataset:
https://www.mapillary.com/dataset/vistas

You will receive an email with download instructions. Save/Move the downloaded zip file into the folder ${RVC_DATA_DIR}/mvd.

After successfully downloading all datasets, execute this script to extract and delete clean up files:  ``` extract_and_cleanup_inst_segm.sh ``` or ```extract_and_cleanup_panoptic_segm.sh ```

### Dataset remapping ###

RVC does not force you to remap the datasets in a certain way. We do provide a "best-effort" mapping, which can be a good starting point. This mapping will contain overlapping classes and some dataset entries might miss relevant labels (as they were annotated using different policies/mixed hierarchical  levels). Combine and remap datasets by executing the script 

 ``` remap_inst_segm.sh ``` or  ``` remap_panoptic_segm.sh ```

## Dataset Format ##

The above step creates a joint training and a separate joint validation json file in COCO Panoptic format:

http://cocodataset.org/#format-data

The "file_name" tag of each image entry and annotation entry has been prepended with the relative path calculated from RVC_DATA_DIR.
These files can directly be used in your training framework.

## Result Submission ##
This repo will be updated as soon as the submission support is ready. See robustvision.net for news.

######################

For the Robust Vision Challenge 2018, we propose two large-scale single-image
depth datasets, i.e. ScanNet and KITTI. Please make sure that you have a minimum
of 150GB-200GB disk space for all (raw) datasets available. If you run out of space
while downloading KITTI raw or ScanNet, you can remove unnecessary zip files
after they have been unzipped.

# ScanNet (see http://www.scan-net.org/ and https://github.com/ScanNet/ScanNet)

For ScanNet, there are two versions of the data. One contains all 2.5 Mio. views with respective depth maps in the raw
ScanNet data format (1.2TB of data). Note that this may take a very long time, as additional to the huge download, you
will need to convert the original raw data into our easily readable Robust Vision data format. As many of the original
views are highly correlated, another variant of the dataset is provided where every 100th frame is available (39GB).

If you want to download only every 100th frame (which we highly recommend), execute:
$ python ScanNet/download-scannet.py --rob_task_data -o datasets_ScanNet/
After downloading all scenes, you can run the following to unzip all scenes and remove
corresponding zip files:
$ bash ScanNet/unzip-and-remove-all-zipped-scenes.sh
Note that the downloaded zips (after unpacking) contain images at the full resolution
of 1296x968 pixels, while depth maps have a bit less than half the resolution (640x480).
You find the intrinsic parameters for the full resolution images in the "intrinsic_color"
folder. The KITTI dataset provides images and depth maps at the same resolution, so you
can downsample ScanNet images to the resolution of the depth maps using:
$ python ScanNet/downsample_color_imgs.py
You will find the downsampled images in the "color_rob" directories, along with intrinsic
parameters in the "intrinsic_depth" directories.

If you want to download all frames in the raw .sens format (and convert
them in a second step), execute
$ python ScanNet/download-scannet.py --type .sens -o raw_data_ScanNet/
You can execute the following bash command to automatically convert all raw
.sens files in raw_data_ScanNet to the Robust Vision default format:
$ bash ScanNet/export-raw-scannet.sh
If you want to convert individual .sens files, use
$ python ScanNet/reader.py --rob --export_depth_images --export_color_images \
    --export_intrinsics --filename raw_data_ScanNet/<scene>/<scene>.sens   \
    --output_path datasets_ScanNet/<scene>

After you have a list of scene*_* directories in the datasets_ScanNet folder, you can
run the following command to assign the scenes according to their dataset split (train, val, test)
$ python ScanNet/assign_scenes_to_split.py


# KITTI Depth (see http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_prediction)

Download depth maps and intrinsics for training data:
$ wget -P datasets_KITTI https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/avg-kitti/data_depth_annotated.zip
$ unzip -d datasets_KITTI datasets_KITTI/data_depth_annotated.zip
Use the KITTI raw download script (thanks to Omid Hosseini for sharing) to download KITTI raw:
$ cd raw_data_KITTI && bash raw_data_downloader.sh && cd ..
Note that you can remove all image_00, image_01, oxts, and velodyne_points folders if you need
to free some disk space (those files are not required for our challenge):
$ rm -rf raw_data_KITTI/2011_*_*/2011_*_*_drive_*_sync/image_0[0,1]
$ rm -rf raw_data_KITTI/2011_*_*/2011_*_*_drive_*_sync/oxts
$ rm -rf raw_data_KITTI/2011_*_*/2011_*_*_drive_*_sync/velodyne_points
Selected data (RGB, depth maps, and intrinsics) for validation and test splits:
$ wget -P datasets_KITTI https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/avg-kitti/data_depth_selection.zip
$ unzip datasets_KITTI/data_depth_selection.zip -d datasets_KITTI/
$ rm -rf datasets_KITTI/depth_selection/test_depth_completion_anonymous
$ rm -rf datasets_KITTI/depth_selection/val_selection_cropped/velodyne_raw
$ mv datasets_KITTI/depth_selection/val_selection_cropped datasets_KITTI/val_selection
$ mv datasets_KITTI/depth_selection/test_depth_prediction_anonymous datasets_KITTI/test
$ rmdir datasets_KITTI/depth_selection
Now, you will need to gather left and right color images from the KITTI raw data to
match with the GT depth maps (which are already aligned with the RGB images). You can
choose to either write a text file containing all matching depth and RGB images (-t txt)
or copy/move/softlink KITTI raw images into the KITTI depth folder structure (-t copy/..)
$ python KITTI/gather_raw_images.py -d datasets_KITTI/train -r raw_data_KITTI/ -t txt -o kitti_train
$ python KITTI/gather_raw_images.py -d datasets_KITTI/val -r raw_data_KITTI/ -t txt -o kitti_val
If you use the -t move option for train and val, you can remove all contents of
the raw_data_KITTI folder to free some more disk space, as all required data
is located in the datasets_KITTI folder.

## Dataset Format ##
####################

We use the original KITTI depth prediction format, compare KITTI/readme.txt.
A short summary:

Depth maps (annotated and raw Velodyne scans) are saved as uint16 PNG images,
which can be opened with either MATLAB, libpng++ or the latest version of
Python's pillow (from PIL import Image). A 0 value indicates an invalid pixel
(ie, no ground truth exists, or the estimation algorithm didn't produce an
estimate for that pixel). Otherwise, the depth for a pixel can be computed
in meters by converting the uint16 value to float and dividing it by 256.0:

depth(u,v) = ((float)I(u,v))/256.0;
valid(u,v) = I(u,v)>0;

RGB images are stored as 3-channel RGB images, and intrinsics are stored in
txt file containing 9 float values, that, if cast to a 3x3 matrix represent:

f_x     0   o_x
  0   f_y   o_y
  0     0     1

Where focal length in horizontal and vertical axis are given by f_x and f_y,
and the focal point by (o_x, o_y).


## Dataset Structure

You can find dataset splits for training, validation and testing for both
datasets in the following structure:
